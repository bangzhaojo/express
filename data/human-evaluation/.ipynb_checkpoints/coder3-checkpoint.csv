some background: it all started in january 2020 i was 15 at the time i met this girls lets call her L
  

  
L and i had some past together we used to go to the same kindergarten and the same table tennis training.
  

  
Our feelings cought up quickly in a matter of a month, i had a job in my school as a dj and i invited her to the party and when i felt the time was right i played a romantic song to the whole school party (everyone enjoyed it) i turned to her and asked her to be my gf ,she said yes and thats where i had my first kiss. Our realationship began but because of her strict parents we were only allowed to meet on the weekends. i was okay with that and at the first it felt like an eternity between those weekends. I thought that we were having a great realationship and for the first time in years i felt <mask> and i was able to accept myself. Summer came.... she misbehaved and her parents banned her from me and from all of her devices. I tried to reach out to her in the first couple of days after that i just simply gave up because she was not able to answer. One day about 2 weeks into the punishment she texted me from her mothers phone i texted back i thought she was allowed to text me for that one time. Another two weeks passed and she got all of her things back, she went on a rampage how i am the worst how dare i not to call her or to be under her window at night.","['happiness', 'happy']","['happy', 'confident']",option1,3.0,"Both are possible.

I thought it was getting better a few months later. I was working with a therapist and improving my self esteem and other mental health issues. Ive always had chronic low self esteem as my step father was emotionally abusive and my mother was emotionally absent. 

Valentines Day came. I bought a sexy set of lingerie and when I tried it on alone I felt so hot. I waited until he got home and showed him. I felt sexy so I was feeling myself. He laughed at me. For what felt like a minute. I was confused until he told me I looked ridiculous and that I should go change. He then went to his computer and started playing something. I put on my pajamas and told him I was going to bed early. I later told him I didnt like when he said that and I felt unwanted. He denied he ever said it. 

After more months of this I could feel the <mask> I had for him. So I ended it. I had so much resentment I could feel it always just under the surface. I thought my resentment was aversion to him being a man. It felt right at the time to never want to be with a man again. 

Over the next two years I have done a lot of growth and maturing. After finding a man at tractor supply undeniably attractive I accepted that I wasnt gay like I though I just resented him so much I viewed all men as him. I resented men to a degree.

Now Im trying to work through the left over resentment so I can keep working on myself. I just blame myself so much and Im working on reminding myself that Im worth more than what he had made me believe.

24261,bypco8," I was also honestly super scared for their well being, especially my brother who had already been abused by my cousin as a kid (my aunt and mother were also abused by my uncles. This what I meant by fucked up family). I just kind of panicked. 

So the next day, my aunt went to work and I knew she would be there late. When my mom came home, I instantly told her I needed to tell her something. I sat her down and told her exactly what I saw and heard and she went BALLISTIC. She stormed to her car and drove to my aunts job. My aunt never came back. 

My brother is now very upset with me. He told me that theyre two consenting adults and can do whatever they want and that they werent hurting anybody and that it was never my business. He has all of his stuff packed and hes planning on driving across the country to be with her tonight. My mom is still livid about it and told every single one of my family members. They all HATE my aunt now and want nothing to do with her. This made me feel guilty because they used to absolutely adore her. 

Now Im <mask> wondering if I made an asshole move by telling on them. My family is a mess, my mom who already had issues has seemingly gone off the rails, my aunt is all on her own and my brother might never forgive me.

EDIT/UPDATE: My brother left late last night/early this morning to be with my aunt. I tried to stop him but he was adamant that none of this was her fault and that he was the one who started it and couldnt let her deal with this on her own.

I dont understand what happened, its not like weve never discussed serious before. We have very open and radical communication and honesty. So I fail to understand what triggered this bout of whatever this is.:(

Im panicking, I dont know what to do. My partner is an amazing, wonderful person and aside from the inner daily inner turmoil and frustration, I also hate to put them through this. I miss them too, and I just dont understand why I feel this way or why this is happening. Im <mask>.

My friend from a long time ago gets anything he wants. He has a financially stable family and he can get along with anyone. I don't know if he realizes it but he's a dick. He treats me like shit and anyone who he feels opposes him or doesn't want to associate with him anymore, he would talk about them behind their back or try to get others not to like that person. It's funny because he always says he doesn't like talking behind people's backs.

Getting back on track, I THINK I might like a person from our friend group. Me, the friend mentioned above, we'll call him Tyler, two of my other friends and the person who I think I might like, we'll call her Jessica, went out. Tyler and Jessica we're playing around together a lot through out that whole day and whole night. That night we all slept in the same tent (we were camping). My other 2 friends were asleep, while Jessica Tyler and I were all up. They didn't know I was up and they kept messin around.

Here's where im just playing it by ear. I fell asleep for abt 5-10 minutes because I felt <mask> seeing them playing and giggling under the covers. Tyler woke me up and proceeded to tell me that they were playing and one thing lead to another and she ended up giving him a BJ. He doesn't know if I like her, she doesn't know if I like her, and even I don't know if I like her. My emotions are just stirred up right now and I don't know how I should feel.

Edit 1: I wish it was that simple to just cut him out but he has a way with words that got me most of the things I have today. He could bring me more value in the future.

Edit 2: He doesn't really like her like that, which he told her after and she was ok with it, and he didn't know what to do in the awkward silence. He thought it'd be logical to wake us all up saying he seen someone out side of the tent. [{That's when me and him walked and talked and since im his best friend he decided to tell me about his ""awkward encounter."" To him she's like one of the guys.}]

At 24 a man semi-regularly said very inappropriate things about me and to me as jokes and I didn't have the support of a female friend, she didn't understand how uncomfortable and slightly unsafe it made me feel, at the very least it made me feel ick, but she defended him. At 27 a man got really weird with his money, suddenly buying me expensive stuff out of nowhere, and I felt bought, like I would owe him, like he was coming on incredibly strong with some intentions that I didn't even reciprocate. It raised my alarms. Sent stuff back and cut him quickly. I don't think about these men much but I know they have their lasting effects on my mind. I also watched my best friend put herself into dangerous situations when we were teenagers and I sometimes think about how lucky I am to have her here and not lost her over 15 years ago, because she was taken, she could have been completely taken away from me but instead she was manipulated for years. She's never talked about it but I feel quite <mask> thinking how her girlhood was essentially taken. At least that's how I see it from my perspective. Especially these days.

A lot of men just suck to be honest so it's not surprising to see kpop idols doing similar things. But it's really scary as we support and love them.

There is an issue though, I'm very much not bisexual, I've thought about it a lot and I may be biromantic at best. However, he feels different.

Day 30-41 Regulated emotion. Peaks and troughs have levelled out. Had honest conversations with those closets to me about myself. Set some real achievable goals. Priorities found some meaningful order. Sleeping the best sleep ever and routinely. 

Day 41 + 42 - Have you lost weight? I looked noticeably healthier. Pride in my appearance improved. Started making real progress on working towards my goals. More disciplined than I thought I was ever capable of. Thought of being sober forever scared me and I also felt <mask>. I was <mask> with my 42 days but wanted more success quicker - I had to stay patient and let the feeling wash away as it was making me want to drink. It was unpleasant. I spent a little too much money and ate junk food without thinking about it to find some dopamine. I listened to a lot and i mean a lot of David Goggins material. Bought his book. 

Day 43 - 50 I am staying sober instead of not drinking. I actively search for the things I enjoy now. I make time for waking, exercise and reading. I attended a work event with free booze. Grabbed a can opened it and took a swing. In shock I worried I had grabbed a beer by mistake as it felt so natural. I had actually greeted a few people and grabbed a can of coke by instinct. I wasnt worried about taking a drink of alcohol. That made me think if I need to be more aware and not get lazy with my thinking or pleased that it was my first instinct to grab a soft drink.

I've had multiple neurologists over the last few years and several Sleep Studies and MSLTs with second and third opinions on the matter. I have an 83 second average sleep onset latency. I also have really bad ADHD, diagnosed as an adult when I was 25 (early 2016). 


I've tried everything I feel like at this point. Armodafinil, Modafinil, Wakix, Sunosi, etc... All of them never felt like they were treating the root problem. I kept telling my doctors that the problem to me felt like my sleep was never restful or restorative and that if that could be addressed I wouldn't need all the other medications. I remember asking about xyrem and being told that it wasn't approved for IH and that there was nothing that could be done.


Half the problem was that all of the wakefullness aids were causing my ADHD to amp up to the point where no matter how much Adderall, Concerta, etc... I took, I was still struggling with hyperfocus, forgetfulness, lack of mindfulness, and general impulse control/compulsive behavior. It was getting so bad that I was <mask> about losing my job due to the unintentional neglect towards it that I didn't realize was happening until I was showing up routinely on SLA violation reports (I work in IT). It was a huge problem. I was effectively a walking zombie.

33738,oj5kke,"The Power Of Desire. Hello Brothers,

Its been a while since my last posting and for good reason. I have been busy on my journey and have experienced a metamorphosis in the past weeks. My life is changing before my very eyes and as scary as that can be it has also been exciting. While meditating just now I had another epiphany about Semen Retention that Id like to share with my brethren. Allow me to enlighten yall on the power of desire. 

Sexual energy in nature is all about desire. Its a craving for what we dont have and when we get it (sex) it is met with release and that feeling is gone. While retaining Ive noticed my desire grow in a manner I can only describe as burning. I feel a <mask> flame inside my body that wants to be fed. The more I transmute and retain and feel gratitude towards God the more this flame grows by the day. Its slow, its subtle but its growing men and there only two options. Be consumed by the flames or learn to harness it. Ive already made it abundantly clear that I am under the belief that the mind controls all. Our thoughts shape are realities. Anything we desire can be manifested through concentrated thought, applied faith, and taking action with the energy weve been blessed with. As I said my desire has been burning strong and with it so has my ambition. I desire more and more in this life and the limitations I held myself to are breaking down. At first I thought this to be Greed. Why should I desire so much when I can be content with what I have. Ill never find peace if I continue to yearn for the unreachable but as my mediations have gotten deeper and realization hit me. Why not me ? Why shouldnt I have everything I ever wanted? The universe is infinitely abundant. There is enough for all of us to have everything we desire. This fire burning inside me has illuminated the truth. We should all have riches, we should all be able to take care of our parents and experience everything weve ever wanted. We are men and a big factor of that is our capacity for competition and domination. So men you want that promotion at work why not you ? Go out and take it.

24590,s3vlzu,"I am self-indulgent and minimally productive, and Im OK with that. Questioning the American work ethic. **TL;DR:**  The traditional American work ethic, while admirable and (perhaps) good for the collective, can be unhealthy for the individual.  Many of us would be better off if we embraced a degree of self-centered self-indulgence and devoted ourselves to self-actualization instead of productivity, paid work or the greater good.  

I often feel <mask> watching remarkably talented friends trade their mental and physical health to climb someone elses ladder.  Many of them radiate an unmistakable din of desperation for a more tolerable life.  The concern I feel for them motivated me to post this. 

In the US, the ethos of 'meaningful hard work and achievement' is so deeply rooted that most of my peers never question it. Why is this? Why do people continue to work in unhealthy environments when they could stop working decades before they finally do so? Obvious contributing factors include low wages, lifestyle inflation, financial illiteracy, etc.  However, I believe that there are additional, less acknowledged variables at play.  Below I discuss a few potential contributing factors. 

Until very recently humans had trouble obtaining the basics in life: shelter, food, safety, etc.. It was hard to get enough and nearly impossible to acquire a surplus sufficient for peace of mind. Those humans who continually strove for extra were disproportionately likely to pass on their genes. 

Today things are different. Its feasible for many workers in highly developed economies to obtain not only the necessary basics but also to have a sufficient surplus (e.g., an emergency fund) for unexpected developments. With this comes the question: at what point should people stop pursuing more? I see this phenomenon manifested in the many, many posts where people say Can I actually FIRE at this point? Should I work a few more years to build up a little bit of extra savings?

Further, many people have incomplete identities and few, if any, real passions in life.  Therefore, they rely on paid work, artificial goals and milestones (e.g., degrees, promotions, titles, etc.) as a source of identity, meaning and reward.  The fact that so many Americans derive their primary meaning and identity from work is, arguably,  a reflection of deficiencies in their non-work lives.",['sadness'],['discomfort'],option1,2.0,‘Sadness’ is more specifically applicable,,,1.0,LLM

As I awaited with the guard for their arrival, I kept thinking of Sierras written warnings, and how stupid I had been to dismiss them.

The police quickly took down my account of events and, leaving me in the care of a young officer, went upstairs to inspect the office. There had been no one coming or going from the building since I ran out, so it was possible that the culprit was still hiding out somewhere inside. The thought made me nauseous, and I shifted closer to my armed companion. Not long after the cops left us, the young officers radio crackled and several voices spoke one over the other, asking for backup and naming codes I couldnt understand. Things escalated quickly from there. Instead of going home, I was taken to a police station and held in an interrogation room for hours before someone finally came to speak to me. I was <mask>, miserable, and confused at the way the events of the night were unfolding. I wanted to go home but spent several more hours recounting my story to two detectives.

So, you had the knife with you when running from the kitchen to your desk? Are you sure? asked the older detective, who had introduced himself as Senior Investigator Barnshaw.

Going through his pictures over the years, I noticed that he often appears sad, except in pictures taken when I visited, where he looks radiant. This broke my heart a little. Was my father depressed because he missed me? He never confided in me this much; my father grew up at a time when men were supposed to ""toughen up"" and ""deal with it"", so he never really talked about how he felt or what he wanted. I would often ask him whether he thought about taking up a hobby (he retired early), but he would always dismiss the notion, ""I'm fine really"" he would say, ""I have enough to do at home"".

It's been nearly four weeks now, as of the time of this writing. Family and friends tell me ""You have to move on, your father would have liked to see you live a happy and fulfilling life"".

I can often feel a knot in my stomach form when the thought returns.

^(Posting on this sub, bcz this feels like a safe space to open up.)

We met about a year ago, under some very weird circumstances. Basically, I had enrolled in this online course (not gonna explain what), and during one of the live sessions - my stream gave up. I texted support and she called me back asap to help me out. And, since then, I've always naturally loved to talk to her.

I personally feel that our vibes match, she's often told me that I'm bright and really mature for my age, which isn't something super new - I've been hearing this ever since I was a kid.

I've recently started believing that she's way smarter than what she initially gives the impression because I've been noticing this pattern - she doesn't reveal all her cards at once. She calls herself a 'listener' and doesn't always talk a lot about herself. For example, this one time when I was feeling <mask> and was talking to her, I asked about her childhood, explicitly - to which she super nicely replied that she doesn't wanna talk about it.  
We don't usually talk or text everyday, but when we do text - it expands over a matter of days.

Whenever I feel the need for some advice/wisdom, she's one of those people I go to. She's like my safe space. Like this one time, I told her that about my identity crisis, to which she replied - ""You're at the right age of identity crisis. You're blooming and choosing who you want to be as a human. It's a nice process, embrace it."" This might seem a very weird/out of the box response, but it honestly connects all the dots and makes a lot of sense.

About the chat being sexual and stuff, our conversation never went towards those topics. Except, this one time, I'm not sure what got into me and I started lightly flirting - she didn't flirt back.

Details that I had noticed and appreciated during my watch session: 

\- I loved the increasing ""uh"" vowel drone at the end of Part I. It cultivated such an unsettling feeling in me, I felt so <mask>.  - The camera framerate dropping occasionally during Part II as well as Part III was a really good touch to the camera movement.  - The rock that Wyatt threw down the stairs seemed to fall infinitely, hitting neither the 90 degrees turning wall nor the door at the end of the staircase. It instantly conveyed this idea that the stairs could be manipulated in terms of passage beyond what we can comprehend, upwards and/or downwards. This may have been detailed more when Wyatt was not able to escape the underground mall.  - The eerie sounds coming from the lightbulbs during Part II built up so much suspense. The first door leading into the mall had amazing sound effects as well.  - The camera framerate being more in line with what a real VHS recorder would produce made the film feel more immersive to me. The 23.976 fps VHS videos are amazing as well, but I am really loving 29,97 fps for this. The animation still looks really believable even with higher framerate.

That only lasted for a few moments, however, as Vulcans eyes spotted me. They quickly relit with hatred directed towards me. Although they sat up, they didnt try to run away again, just glaring at me. Out of Vulcan started emitting a low growl, surely telling me to piss off.

Im <mask> Im going to have to disappoint you, Vulcan.

I was pressured into sex without a condom another time, by a different women. 

I'm just really <mask> about all of this.
I guess my question is this. How do you deal with your sexual transgressions or violations that you never realised were abnormal? Or are they normal for children and teenagers? And where is the line? I mean there probably is no line, but thats what makes this even more confusing.

I (28F) and my husband (30M) are in a secretly horribly abusive relationship. We have been married 6 years. Together for 8. My husband has verbally, physically, and emotionally abused me since the day we got engaged. I think I stayed with him because of my horribly low self esteem. Anyway, I have also yelled in anger and damaged things. I never did this before I married him. These years of trauma have warped me.

I was referred to as an early career candidate, and when I tried to negotiate and gave a detailed list of how my experience applied using their own job description, they ignored almost all of it and didnt budge at all.

Complete emptiness, blankness. Only EXTREME depression/anxiety. There is not one second of relief I ever feel. Not. One. Second. Alls I feel is heart pounding unease, anxiety, self hate, dullness, and the worst depression my therapists have ever heard of. 
I have no more likes, interests, motivation. I cant feel <mask> from anything. Not even tv.

I have a problem with feeling sexual pleasure. I have sex with my boyfriend regularly and rarely I do enjoy it. I communicated with my boyfriend about this issue before and he wants to help me because he wants sex only when I enjoy it. Before we had sex for the first time I really wanted to try it and I initiated the first time but since it was boring and I haven't felt pleasure.

The problem with this is that sometimes the feeling is super awesome, sometimes I don't feel any pleasure from it at all and sometimes I feel like it is too much and I feel more of a pain than a pleasure from how my clitoris is sensitive. This is so strange because I experience this randomly no matter what I do. 

I enjoyed penetration probably just twice. For the first time, I felt like my pussy itched. When my boyfriend penetrated me it was an awesome feeling. We didn't have any foreplay before and we didn't do anything unusual so I have no idea how to recreate this again.

I spend the next 30 minutes in my head ruminating about how clumsy she is and how bad a person I am for snapping at her.

After \~8 months of regular mindfulness mediation: I realize I am feeling <mask> and remember that I haven't eaten anything all day. I now go about doing tasks knowing that I might have an abnormal reaction to things and I should try to have a snack when I can. My wife drops something and I am aware that my body is impulsively about to snap at her, so I focus on the fact that hunger is causing negative thoughts and it's no ones fault that a noise startled me. I try to ask in a compassionate way if she is OK. It feels really uncomfortable to ""switch"" to compassion, but I don't ruminate afterwards.

I was always a shy kid. The kind of kid that avoided making eye contact and rarely spoke unless spoken to. As I grew older, my shyness turned into something much more debilitating. I evolved into someone who was consumed by darkness that robbed me of my ability to live a normal life.

During this period I didn't know much about mental health and it was tough for me to talk about my thoughts and feelings. I was <mask> that people would make fun of me or think I was weak. I didn't want anyone to judge me and think I was broken.

In 2006, at the age of 13, I was dealt a crushing blow when I was diagnosed with a cruel quartet of mental health struggles: severe anxiety, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and depression. These debilitating conditions made each day an unbearable burden, every moment a suffocating struggle, every social interaction a source of terror, leaving me feeling helpless, alone, and desperate for a way out.

This is where the Medication Trials start.

i just kinda wish i was able to feel romantic <mask> normally. dating apps always seem hard for me and a lot of the people ive met through there (with the exception of one, my ex who i dated for almost a year) i feel like ive had to force myself to like them. but then like the one time i actually naturally like someone its almost always unrequited in some sort of way. i am definitely romance favorable and allosexual (i think, could possibly be acespec(, in that i want to be in a relationship with someone, but i feel like i wont ever be able to find someone i actually am romantically attracted to.

edit: also i guess for clarification this person told me they were not aromantic, although at one point they thought they were, so i guess the idea of them developing feelings for me is possible although i really have no expectations.","['frustrated', 'attraction']","['conflicted', 'attraction']",option1,2.0,The passage as a whole is more indicative of frustration,,,0.0,SD

And so I told him I was <mask> and needed to make my way home to sleep for my work shift the next day. And he like, stared at me the way he did earlier, like that wasnt what he wanted to hear, and laughed at me again. But this time I laughed back. And he said ""alright, then. I'll let you go home to sleep""

- AND I TOKYO DRIFTED OUT OF THAT PARKING LOT SO GOTDAMN FAST!!!!

- no but seriously, I bolted. So fast in fact I didnt know until a few minutes later that shit face left his keys in my car. The keys to his new truck hes supposed to be getting, the keys to his appartment, the keys to his work building that he owns and does not own a copy of. (I lost them while moving recently. For shame.)

After I made it home, he texted to see if I made it back alright and asked if he could call. I responded letting him know I was genuinely <mask> of being with him and to never contact me again. And I blocked him on everything. He ended up finding my sister on facebook and told her that he was heartbroken, that he has no idea why I ghosted him, and wanted to know if I was alright. And my sister told him okay! she'd message me for him and blocked him too! Solidarity sis. She then called me to ask why I didnt immediately call her, she wouldve driven to Atlanta with her husband lmao. My mother said she wished he would text her, because she has a few things she'd like to say to him.

A few days later, he sent me a request on cash app, requesting the sum total of money he ended up spending for our previous dates and wanted compensation for it. The memo was labeled ""Lmao"". Like he actually thinks what he did was fucking hilarious. I dont ever want to hear someone laugh when they're stressed again. It sends literal shivers down my arms.

So no, he didn't hit me, but I was <mask> he would . If he wanted to, theres nothing I could do to stop him. And I was the one driving, that scared me even more.","['tired', 'afraid', 'scared']","['tired', 'afraid', 'afraid']",Both,12.0,,Terms have essentially the same meaning,,0.0,both

My questions stems from the fact that I am working on recovery from porn addiction. One of the toughest consequences of it is dealing with sexual frustration.   


My wife and I have pretty good sex life when my wife is in the mood which she is during certain periods of the month. Then it can be 1-3 weeks without anything. And now that I am recovering I struggle to deal with the sexual frustration.   


And I am just curious how men who dont watch porn deal with it. I admire any man who doesnt watch porn. FYI I dont masturbate either to not get triggered.   


Today I was scrolling on facebook and one of those joke videos come up where a woman is seen lifting up her shirt to reveal her boobs but then a meme comes up. I have seen it many times but this time I got turned on and I hate that. I didnt masturbate or even think about doing anything sexual but I felt the <mask> and I hate that. I feel so <mask> and anxious that I failed. And I admire any man who would not care for that at all.

Well yesterday I was studying at a coffee shop and my friend was nearby, so she decided to meet up with me. We eventually decided to go hangout at her house for a bit, this was at about 10:30 at night. We hung out for a bit and then I drove home. My ex also lives in the same apartment complex as her, just in a completely different part (it's huge). Well he said that he spends lots of time on the top floor (which is not true) and that he saw my car that night. He said that he had given me the opportunity to tell him I was with her that night when he texted me something like ""well I'm glad you're taking time to focus on yourself tonight"". I didn't tell him I was going to hangout with her because I didn't think it was necessary. We had decided to put our romantic connection on hold and focus on our friendship. Also, it was a spontaneous plan I made at 10:30 pm. 

Anyway, I've never felt afraid of him but I am feeling a little <mask> now. The whole sneaking up to the top floor to look for my car really shook me and then on top of that be called me a couple times and yelled at me. He started telling me that I needed to think carefully about who he has been for me in my life all these years. He sent me messages that seem kind of threatening like where he talks about him not being willing to be there for me in the future if I make the decision to leave him for her. He urged me to consider the connection we have, etc. All the while, also telling me he didn't think I was honest about everything when we were partners. He told me that I am being selfish and that no matter what relationship I am in, I will have to agree to boundaries with my partners. I'm not opposed to some boundaries but I'm not a huge fan of the exhausting amount of communication that can sometimes be a thing depending on the polyamorous relationship. Not that I want like a ""don't ask, don't tell"" kind of secretive relationship, but also I don't need someone informing me every time they want to hang out with a romantic interest.

Our 2 month old twins recently started screaming on their bottles. They'd take a certain amount and then get really uncomfortable. We changed the teat size which helped a few days but then they started again. We tried super paced feeding, more frequent burping, different bottles.

The idea of sex excited me, but I knew that I hated my body, especially so naked, and was also fearing the moment when we would become intimate and have to show our bodies to each other.

I quickly noticed that he had a great sex drive and was ready to go pretty much at any point of the day, every day. I never was, and sex - although it aroused me mentally - really scared me and made me extremely anxious and nervous. I wouldn't let him eat me out because I was way too <mask> to let him see/smell/taste that area and I couldn't even have sex with him because it hurt to even insert the tip of his penis. I was just too <mask> and scared and could never relax and enjoy any of it, which led me to never wanting to even start anything sexual in the first place. Making out never led us anywhere - the maximum that would happen is me sucking him off and him kissing my boobs and my neck, and that was it. Even that was great, but I knew that he wanted more (and so did I, even though I was <mask>) and I knew, logically, that we couldn't be this way forever.

Before I went I shook the equipment to get everyones attention. Thats when she pretended to fall off. She cried alligator tears about how I tried to murder her. I tried to kill her. Everyone saw how I was a bad person. No one spoke to me after that. Maybe I shook the equipment as a sign I was giving up. Giving in to what she was saying.

I made sure to voice my compliments towards her and gave her time to relax afterwards in sauna by putting the kid to sleep by myself. But nothing happened.

We have it comparatively easy because she's incredibly healthy otherwise. She still has Halloween candy from last year!

It ranged from joking about my size (I'm 6'1"" and 3 inches taller than my boyfriend, and yes, the weather is fine up here and no, I don't play or even like basketball, I get those a lot) to the fact that we are currently living together, pre-marriage.

The closest I came to a ""convert"" was my own wife, whom I love with all my heart. Like, fairytale romance love. I can't even put into words how much I adore her. I'm not flexing or anything weird like that, I only want to impress how central she is to my life and my self-perception. I am incomplete without her. She wasn't an evangelical when we met. Not sure she ever was, really. She was raised by a Christian father, though. In my 16 years of ministry, she never made a public confession and never opted to be baptized into the fellowship I grew up with (having been christened as an infant in the Lutheran church), but she came to trust in God through my ministry. Then came the crisis of faith brought on by the Trump/evangelical toxic bromance of 2015. I was <mask>, she was concerned, and I ended up leaving the ministry for good as soon as I found another stable job in a different field. She's in the process of deconstructing/deconverting right now, too. And even though we're in mostly the same place, I... I feel like I've failed her. Failed God. Like all my years in the pulpit were for nothing. And even though I've distanced myself from my evangelical roots and the fearmongering and hypocrisy that I experienced, there is a part of me still that is terrified that I am (or will be) to blame for my wife -- a woman I love with all of my being -- being condemned to hell. This thought haunts me. My failure as a preacher and evangelist was one thing, but thinking of my own doubts and deconstruction as destroying her faith only to learn in the end that I led her to condemnation is torturing me.

My husband had to take on a lot of finances because I wasn't able to contribute much, which sucks.

She took offense to them moving so far away from husband, not withstanding she had moved 350km plus already. The Company offer to airfare weekends (not cheap as it is a regional airport) or accommodate him with her in Capital City was insufficient and she felt she was treated unfairly in the entire process.

WO and I have discussed that this might be my last tourist season Thinking about setting sail on an adventure now that that travel restrictions have lifted. Around the coast of this place is a big adventure waiting. As they say YOLO

And Baby GM is out of my life forever!!!  Even though I dont feel <mask> about it I have a feeling that might come

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the support.  Over the last couple of days I have discovered just how much AM fought for me.  He basically found anyone in the company who had worked with or for me including a former GM he clashed with personally. All yesterday I was getting calls people I haven't seen for years because he reached out to them on my behalf.  The ex GM in particular was a surprise because he left the company!

I remember the sinking feeling in my heart as I read his comment. I felt blessed by a man so above my stature that it made me feel spotlighted in oddest, best and worst type of way. Nearly every hour on the hour Id do a quick log in and hope to see the little message icon highlighted in the upper right hand corner of my screen.

I stared down at it for a minute, a black fabric shroud was tightly wound around a wooden box. My address was stamped in red lettering over the thick velvety veil. Next to it lay the words From: Vincent Valentine.

I reached down letting my hands grasp around the extravagant box. With a gentle tug I raised it off of the ground. The concrete seemed so boring and mundane compared to the package. I almost felt <mask> that I had let it sit there even for just a moment. 

With a quick spin I turned around, slammed my door shut and proceeded over to my kitchen table. I tried to find the seams of the dark fabric, tugging along the edges but to my surprise found none.

From here it took me a moment to comprehend how I was going to open it without damaging the pristine void like cover.

It was pretty neat seeing them because I havent seen them in a while and I always got along great with her father. We have the same sense of humor and its the same sense of humor that Cassie has too. I always enjoyed going over to my wifes familys events when he was there because he was someone I could relate to and talk to without feeling too uncomfortable.

After a while, all the younguns were in my backyard having a good time playing Beer Pong and Cornhole so I sat down with Cassies father to have a beer and chat to see how things were going. There was a bunch of small talk, and he asked how Cassie was doing in the city because he knows we hang out a lot. I told him she was staying out of trouble, doing well in school, and an all-around joy to have as company. Then he asked how Cassie and I were doing This puzzled me.

Welp, apparently Cassie had sought the advice of her parents in this whole thing. She has a great relationship with them, so Im not <mask> she asked for some advice, but I was <mask> that she spoke with them about me specifically instead of using hypotheticals. What followed was a very good, in depth conversation with her father. It turns out that they like me a lot and dont care one way or the other. They basically told Cassie to do what she felt was right and theyd support her either way. They know me and they know how well I treated their niece. They had voiced their two obvious concerns (age and my wife being her cousin) but said that I was a good guy and she could do a lot worse. If it was something that we both wanted, then they would support it. The gist of what he told me was: Stop worrying about what everyone else thinks and just be happy. Youve been through a lot, probably more than anyone your age should go through, but you deserve to be happy too. If you are worried about what I or her mother think, dont be, because honestly, we just want our daughter to be happy. If you make her happy, then we support it.

No windows! No windows! came the mans voice from behind me, and I ducked as he hurled himself towards me and yanked the curtains. I flinched, but no pain came this time.

Its OK, he said. Youll learn the rules, soon.

Over the next few weeks, I learned the rules.

\- No standing near windows.

\- No crying.

\- Always wear nice dresses. 

\- No shouting or screaming

\- Stay in my room unless Im told to come out. 

I was left alone for long periods of time. When they were gone, the windows and doors to my room were locked, so if I needed to go to the bathroom, I would either have to wait until they came back or have an accident. I was always punished for my accidents, but I made sure not to be punished for anything else. 

At first, I cooperated because I feared being physically punished, but after a while, I cooperated for a different reason. Id never been a particularly smart kid, but something clicked inside me, and I knew that if I ever wanted to escape, I needed them to think I was <mask> there with them. 

So I followed their rules and over time, they softened. I was eventually allowed free roam of the house whenever they were present, as long as I stayed away from windows, and, most importantly, whenever anybody knocked on the door, I had to run to my room and stay there until told to come out. 

One day, I was sat in the living room, drawing. The man and woman, who I was forced to call Mom and Dad out loud, were out back, gardening. That day, something happened that had never happened before. As the man had come inside with the shopping, I noticed he forgot to lock the front door behind him, and, after Id given him my fakest, sickly-sweet, Hi Daddy, he had gone straight through the house, out the back, to help his wife with the gardening. 

I took my chance. I didnt have shoes as I wasnt allowed to wear them in the house and I was obviously not allowed to leave the house, but I decided it didnt matter.

He was unreachable and I was so <mask> for him. He was offline and I just wanted a confirmation na hes okay. If he wanted space, Ill give it to him naman.

If you told me a year ago that life was worth living, I would have laughed in your face. This time last year, I was heavily <mask>, with no way to see the sun. I was feeling <mask> with all the stuff that was going on and all the major life events that were happening. I was stuck for a long time with no way to free myself. My family treated me like I didn't exist. I had nothing I was genuinely living for except my partner and my cats. A year ago I was living through the notions of every day life with no hope for the future. My CPTSD flaired up constantly. I was living in fight-or-flight mode where everything and anything was triggering. I was also passively s*icid$l. I tried to find reasons to keep myself going, but sadly, came up short handed. Then came the hospitalization that was a severe wake up call for me. I was put in a psychiatric hospital because of self h#rm and my doctor was worried about me. He had every right, because I was actively making a plan for me to finally do it. My life had changed. That was a couple weeks before Thanksgiving and about ten days after my birthday. 

This brings me to the present. Today I have found successful ways to manage my CPTSD triggers. I also got a definite diagnosis of borderline personality disorder that I am learning to manage, as well. That hospital trip changed my life. The caring and compassion that the docs showed in my darkest hours were some of the best things that could have happened to me. I have also recovered some pretty disturbing memories that I am learning to compartmentalize until I can be better equipped to deal with them. I no longer feel like I am living on the edge. I feel 100% different than I did this time last year. I know that it does get easier, and life becomes manageable. Now, I feel like I can manage a lot better than I did a year ago, and honestly, it feels great!

For background, I had serious depression for about a year prior to this, and I nearly took my life twice. I was only 14. I could go into the cause of that depression and everything that happened but this isnt about my depression, its about the unknown issue that followed it. Ill probably refer to it as a delusion for simplicitys sake, but I have no idea what it actually was or if Im using the word correctly-

I dont know exactly when it started, maybe around October 2019? Sometime in autumn or early winter. Im pretty sure the initial thing that triggered all this was when mom had made me attend a sex-ed class that included nothing about sex ed and everything about outdated religious practices. I already had extreme discomfort towards the topic, which led to many occasions where Id have to bring my hoodie and cry silently in the back of the room, I just felt so <mask> being surrounded by people, told that I have to fit in a specific box or Im going to hell forever, and having to act like I agreed to everything said or face problems.
I tried to block it out so I dont remember exactly what was taught, but it was a destructive mix of you must stay abstinent and your whole life purpose is to reproduce.
So basically
If you want to date, you have to intend to get married, or youre going to hell.
If you get married, you have to have sex whenever your husband wants, or youre going to hell.
If you have sex, you must try to bear children, or youre breaking your wedding vows, thus going to hell.",['anxious'],['uncomfortable'],option2,3.0,Extreme discomfort’ suggests ‘uncomfortable’,,,1.0,SD

I spoke to another person about the situation and they were very supportive too, they suggested that I message the guy and explain how he had been and why it wasn't okay, just because it's important that he knows in case he didn't know or understand. I thought about it for a few hours and then eventually did. I wrote up a long message explaining things, I was very careful about my language so that it didn't come across accusatory. He replied very soon after, very apologetic, very insistent that he really didn't realise and would never have intentionally made me feel that way etc. I can tell he was genuine about it all.

But this is my problem now. I feel like I'm not allowed to feel upset or uncomfortable about what happened now. I feel <mask> for feeling upset about it because he didn't realise, or intend to be pushy or aggressive, I'm <mask> that if I don't just kind of move forward, people will think I'm just being dramatic.

Is it valid for me to feel uncomfortable and distressed still about what happened, even if I don't have hard feelings necessarily for the guy who did it?

Edit 2: I would like to add, as I feel I've been unclear here, I did tell him to stop several times, I told him ""no, I need to sleep"" a number of times, perhaps I wasn't super explicit and assertive in the way I told him, but I did tell him. I wasn't reciprocating, at times I was just lying there letting him continue because I knew if I pushed his hands off me again they would be back again a few moments later.

19729,609y5z,"I feel <mask> and humbled. Yesterday I had my 4th experience with magic mushrooms, 3 grams of dried Golden Teachers. My previous experiences have all been with Penis Envy mushrooms so I was a little apprehensive about eating a whole eighth of Golden Teachers since 2 grams of the Penis Envys was extremely intense. Anyways this trip was not as intense, but these Golden Teachers definitely are called that for a reason. It made me think a lot about existence and free will. There are literally no rules for life, if I wanted to I could go run outside naked and there's nothing stopping me. Sure there are immediate consequences but in the long run those consequences don't matter. Now I'm not saying I'm going to go out and do crazy things now but it definitely gives me a sense a freedom and confidence that I did not have prior to this experience. I also though about how insignificant most of our lives our. Eventually we will die and everyone who once knew us will die of too and eventually we will be forgotten. I know this sound depressing but I think of it in a more liberating sense. If nothing you do really matters than what do you got to lose you know? This also attributed to the sense of freedom I've gained. I feel that the purpose of our lives is to make it meaningful and in the end to leave something behind so maybe you won't be forgotten.

## Goal 09 - Get to cp09  - Section total : 10 miles

As we got to cp08, Anne (the 2nd placed lady) came in just behind us, Anne had gotten completely lost for over half an hour in a country park, her GPS watch had run out of battery and she had no idea which way to go.

My chafing was getting bad and I needed to spend a little bit of time sorting everything out. After applying a very liberal amount of Vaseline at the back of a car park, (Ultrarunning is a glamorous sport) we got ready to head out and climb Fan Brycheiniog, the longest climb of the race.

It was 1.45am and I had been moving for nearly 20 hours. Our group now had 5 of us in, myself included. I was feeling very <mask> but I do enjoy a good climb so I got my head down and started up the hill.

I seemed to have a massive burst of energy and started flying up the ascent. I left the group behind and after about 45 mins of climbing and four false summits I made it to the top. It was at this point I realised Id made a bit of a mistake.

I was 76 miles into the race and as I reached the summit, I suddenly felt completely exhausted. My feet had started to hurt and I didn't even want to think about what was going on downstairs. The thought of still having 7 miles to run to get to the checkpoint started to weigh heavy on my mind.

I was groomed several times as an adolescent. Oral sex was performed on me. I have never, ever, been present/able to enjoy receiving oral sex like I can be with other sex acts. I often get so in my head that I loose my erection and even when I have reached the finish line in the past I've had to think about something mundane to distract me while it happens. 

Today though, I had that experience that I have been missing out on my whole life. Someone I love and care about deeply made me feel really good and when I looked down at them performing the deed, for the first time in my life, I didn't think about the abuse. I was just totally present and in that moment, it was so hot, I felt so <mask>, like it should be, should have been for me all these years.

22444,15osn7p,"[SERIOUS] Don't Trust, Verify. How to look for Iconic Messages in your own Full Bitcoin Node. The Hard Way. As I mentioned a while back, I have some blockchain nodes running on my home lab VMs just for fun and to help out the community. One of them is my own Full Bitcoin Node, so I don't have to rely on outside websites to check my transactions.

Today, I was feeling a bit <mask>, so I decided to check if I actually had the whole ""blockchain"" stored at home. I looked for special messages using some basic commands. Below, I will provide the ""commands"" for conducting blockchain searches. If you want to do this yourself, you can find instructions on how to set up your own node from the Bitcoin.org website.

The commands basically consists in these steps:

\- **bitcoin-cli getblockhash <*****blockid>***: to get the hash for a specific block, we need this to use the following command.

\- **bitcoin-cli getblock <*****blockhash>*** **2**: To retrieve the block data along with transaction data, we use the command getblock. Adding the 2 ensures that transactions data is included. This allows us to utilize a tool like **jq** to manipulate the output and extract desired informationthe raw transaction data in hexadecimal form. This hexadecimal data is further processed using a tool like **xxd**, converting it from hexadecimal to readable ASCII text, and then using **hexdump** to compare the two sets of data.

The final command looks something like this:  **bitcoin-cli getblock** ***<blockhash>*** **2** **| jq '.tx\[*****<txindex>*****\].hex' | xxd -r -p | hexdump -C**

Let's start verifying the top 3 messages embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain:

**1. The Times headline in the Genesis block:** This is particularly evident in the initial block of Bitcoin, known as the Genesis block. Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic originator of the protocol, included this message. It comprises the exact headline from The Times' front page on January 3, 2009, stating: Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks., Let's see if that's true.  Here we don't use a <txindex> because the Genesis block only has 1 transaction.",['curious'],['bored'],option2,1.0,,,,1.0,SD

With one last gourmet meal in my stomach, I set out on an adventure, not knowing the dangers of the real world. I stepped out of my landing capsule, feeling for the first time the unfiltered air of a frontier planet. I had chosen to land in a temperate forest, its lush vegetation would provide me with both food and wood. I felt smart for choosing this location, and I merrily built a shelter and gathered some berries.

According to online guides, it was important to plant crops and so I did. It was quite time consuming, but it gave me a feeling of fulfillment as I tilled the soil and as I could feel the sweat running down my forehead. And everything I did; it was as if I was a child discovering the world. Sure, there were some inconveniences, like having to cook and clean myself, there was the childlike wonder for every new task I did with my own hands. 

As days passed, I settled in my new base. I had cut down some trees to build a decent bedroom and, despite having a shoddy uneven bedframe, I felt <mask>. 

My first interaction with a human on the Rim was quite frightful. The person wasnt wearing anything but a frown and a wooden hand. The stranger charged at me with a rusty knife, but my rifle made them crumble after getting shot twice. They staggered, looking at their wound, then at me in disbelief before falling on the ground with a loud thud that echoed in the forest and in my mind.

It had been instinctive, and my mind was slowly processing that I had just chose a living human being for the first time. With my conscience resurfacing from the initial shock, I rushed to the injured and brought them to an empty room to tend to their wounds. I wasnt very experienced in medical, and so my hands fumbled a few times as I disinfected the burnt wound. The smell of burnt flesh was disgusting, but I was still intent of trying to save the persons life. As the pool of blood grew larger, my heartbeat quickened as well.

31216,10o7v3e,"How do I leave? Am I doing something wrong? Hi all,

Have posted here before and got confirmation that the relationship I am in has been emotionally abusive - it had a lot of belittling, criticism, jealousy, isolation and other bad behaviour. I spoke about this with a therapist too and they said the behaviour seemed abusive. The relationship was very unhealthy for me and left me feeling highly distressed, anxious, depressed and with no confidence.

I am 32M, my partner is 35F. I did manage to leave, but somehow I have managed to be hoovered up by this person and we resumed our relationship, even though it is now long distance.

I have since tried to end the relationship again, but this led to a lot of bargaining, pleading and circular conversations, it just seems like no matter what I say or what reason I give that I am <mask> about the relationship, it made no difference. The caveat to this is that I havent been able to say emphatically and categorically that we are incompatible and that its over between us. I tried to use other reasons like the distance and our life paths and circumstances in an effort to protect her feelings, but this hasnt worked.

She is always asking me about the future, talking about how much she loves me and how much she wants us to be together. She does this multiple times per day. If I imply anything other than 100% commitment to the relationship, she becomes extremely emotional,  says manipulative things (you dont love me, you dont want me anymore, if you did you would not give up on us, etc.) and I end up feeling extremely <mask>. What is going on here, and why cant I leave? I try to be an honest person and not to shy away from uncomfortable conversations, but I feel unable to leave - I feel so <mask> and responsible for this persons feelings that I am paralysed. Its gotten to the point where I feel I am leading her on, even though she also steadfastly refuses to acknowledge any issues Ive brought up or reasons to break up. I dont want to be this way - I have always managed to have mature and respectful conversations when leaving past relationships, even though it is hard. But in this case I feel so <mask> . I have read about trauma bonds and it certainly resonated.

25124,14p4w9r,"(TW: Martial rape) I can't manage to regain love or sexual attraction after my husband sexually assualted me. Long story short, my husband sexually assaulted me through nagging, harassing, and begging for sex until I would break down and give it to him, even if I was crying the whole time. We've been married almost 3 years. We had sex frequently, but would pull this when whenever I wasn't in the mood or was sick. my husband didn't see this as wrong due to his upbringing where he saw his abusive Dad hit, abuse, and rape his mother. He thought because he never physically forced me to do anything it wasn't rape. Coming from a heavily Christian background, I had no sexual experience before marriage so boundaries and what is and isn't okay was harder for me to voice. I also had a hard time communicating because I'm autistic.

This went on for about a year until I had a complete breakdown and went to a psychiatrist to get medicine and a starting seeing a therapist. My therapist was horrified and recommended divorce, which I didn't want. In some warped way, I loved him still. I insisted on therapy for him if he wanted the marriage to continue. Things got better and he feels horrible what he did. Hasn't repeated the actions. But it's been over a year and I completely have lost all feelings for him. Nothing is working. Therapy isn't helping. I tried seeing a sex therapist. It didn't help. It's just not there. I don't want to have sex with him. I don't want to be touched. I don't even really care if he gets hurt or is distressed by something. I just feel <mask>. I chinge and won't respond when he says he loves me. I want to love him again and want sex with him, but I don't know how. I don't want a divorce I've already seen a sex therapist, and all we could conclude was that I'm still sexual and experience attraction and desire, just not for him. There was no advice on improving my current relationship. Just divorce which is not what I want.

How to I move forward and salvage my relationship if I've already tried therapy and it had no positive effects?

My boyfriend (21) and I (22) have been dating and living together for 2 years, he was born in the untied states but raised in Argentina so he has a completely different cultural background than I. We met 2 years ago and havent really been apart since then 3 weeks ago he began presenting symptoms of psychosis.

 I didnt realize at first because he has never prior to me knowing and living with him presented these issues. he works from home and it started as he could hear the neighbors talking about him (I feel like overhearing neighbors is pretty common and didnt initially think much of it) Im sure I could have seen the signs sooner but I was in a bit of denial myself. We just moved from CO to CA and obviously money has been tight, I think these were huge factors in his stress overload. 
It got to a point where he couldnt sleep because of the neighbors so I tried to get him to fall asleep to a guided sleeping track through his soundproof headphones (this usually works for him) he took them off and said he could still hear them. Thats when I realized there was a major problem at hand, because thats not possible. 

After a series of events the next afternoon he had a full blown panic attack and I had no choice (and no idea what to do in this situation) I brought him to the ER where he was admitted, 3 days later he was released from a mental health facility in LA. He began hearing voices less and less until he went a WHOLE week with zero voices and paranoia. 

About 3 days ago it began again. We went to his psychiatrist from the facility almost immediately where she realized that whatever doctor had discharged him forgot to write a prescription for the antipsychotic they had been giving him. She explained this is why he got better for a week (the meds were in his system from the stay) and the reason he slowly got worse again (the meds had left his system) she prescribed him the same thing they had given him prior and we have waited the last 48 hours hoping they begin to help his psychosis.

I had had OCD themes in the past but none of them were sexual, they were health-anxiety and magical thinking themes and I didn't even realise I had OCD at the time (first was washing my hair several times a day because I was <mask> my hair was greasy, then it moved to constantly re-doing my hair at school and getting distressed over it, then it moved onto being convinced I had head lice and pinworms even though I got tested and checked several times for them and never had anything wrong with me. I also had to check several times before shutting a car door or just a regular door or check the toilet before I flushed because I was <mask> that I was flushing down a little puppy or kitten or that I was going to slam a door on one.) When I was 13, I was on p*rnhub and I was browsing through the homepage and I clicked on a random video. It was some Asian video and the girl in it looked scared and underaged. I remember clicking off of it in horror and disgust. I didn't know what it was before I clicked on it and I didn't even know there was illegal p*rn on p*rnhub, but since I have heard about scandals where there wasn't enough moderation on the website and people were posting things like revenge p*rn and rape and cp, beastiality and such without consequence, so it's possible that I did actually come across something illegal although I didn't do anything wrong.

I (21F) went to New York with a man I had met twice at clubs in my city. He seemed like a nice guy and did not want any sexual favors; purely friendship. The first few days were good actually but on my last night I had met a person that I invited to the bars with us. I believe this was the person to roofie me- what followed is a recount from the man I went with. I seemed like I had become very drunk out of nowhere, the roofie person was hanging on me and touching me quite a bit, man I came with asked if I wanted to ditch the stranger, I said yes. Apparently, we left the bar and I wanted to go home but once home I wanted to have a drink. I came to with the man I came with inside of me and presumably blacked out again.

The next morning I woke up and believed I had drank too much but slowly put the pieces together and realized I was hardly tipsy when arriving to the bar. I blame the person who roofied me for doing such an evil thing but I also blame myself and the man I came with. I believe that I should've been smarter than going on a trip like this (I don't think the man I came with pressured me into sex he may have just complied with my advances?) but I also feel like he should've known better than to sleep with someone much younger than he/much drunker.

She said she liked her virtual setup, and it seemed like she thought that going back to in-person would be more hassle than it's worth.

I've been talking with her for around 9 months and have never met her in person. When we first started therapy, I had no clue how deep we'd end up going, and I had no idea how much I desperately wanted to share and feel a connection with another person. I've struggled my entire life with opening up to others and feeling connected, and it almost feels like a cruel joke to find someone I feel <mask> with but to never be allowed to meet them. 

I know many people probably still feel solid connections with virtual relationships, but I also struggle with derealization pretty badly so the whole virtual aspect makes it feel more like a dream within a dream. I just want it to feel real. I want to know that I've shared so much with an actual person that exists outside of my phone.

Weve been together almost five years and foreplay has always been an issue. It has gotten better. But he literally puts in the least amount of effort. Its almost like he doesnt like making out or any of that over the clothes sensual stuff that gets you really turned on. 

Anyway. He asked me for sex tonight while already knowing that being asked for sex like its something Im providing him is a major turn off for me. Plus I was in the middle of getting everything taken care of so I could lay down in bed. And by asking I mean hes literally laying in bed looking at me saying sex please which I know hes trying to be funny. But it just seems so disconnected and like my arousal or enjoyment doesnt matter. I wish he would come up and kiss me on the neck and ask. Ive told him this and to no avail. 

When I finally settled in bed I tried to initiate sex and he just kept looking at his phone. And then when I tried to get foreplay going he said he sometimes doesnt wanna do all that stuff. Im really <mask> and I want foreplay, I wanna feel special. I told him foreplay for me isnt about feeling special, that 95% of the time it ensures I truly get to enjoy sex. I told him I want to make him feel special but asking me for sex and not touching me sexually isnt gonna get things where he wants them to go. Sex is something we do together, not something I provide you with.  He sorta blew me off and got annoyed and just went to bed.

Long version:

I've been struggling pretty bad since around November.

I've been getting multiple flashbacks every day. I have been almost constantly dissociating, either feeling too much or nothing at all. I haven't been able to feel anything on a deep level about my trauma for a while because I keep getting overwhelmed and shutting down.

To deal with it, periodically I've been going into a sensory deprivation tank for 90 minutes. [Here is more information about them for anyone who is curious](<URL> But essentially you're in complete silence and darkness floating in water. For me it feels somewhere in between doing 90 minutes of meditation and having an exorcism. I don't know how else to describe it it's calming, but very intense. And it helps me process a lot of shit.

(edit: also just for clarity, I'm not doing this instead of therapy, I recognize that I still need that. This is just another thing that helps.)

SO YESTERDAY I did this. I spent about an hour inside of the tank meditating, trying to keep my heart rate at a normal non-anxious pace. I felt very <mask>. And then once I felt <mask>, I started allowing myself to follow the thoughts/memories I had of being sexually abused. 

I wasn't able to think through any of the really harsh stuff without having my heart rate become rapid (aka dramatic anxiety increase). So I tried to redirect my attention to the less intense/scary parts.

I started recalling the abuser kissing me. It felt like I was an outside party watching a grown ass man trying to make out with the 3-4 year old version of myself. I had some sensory flashbacks, but I managed to keep my heart rate relatively slow.

I first realised I was different to most other guys when I registered to play Rugby League (big in Australia) at the age of 13 and noticed how good looking and emotionally attached I was to my team mates. I remember specifically telling my Mum of my internal crisis after much self talk and confusion- she responded with 'everyone has those kind of thoughts at your age'. I still remember that conversation well and I was quite <mask> by it - I don't think she realised to the extend of which I had these thoughts and the amount of courage it took me to talk about them. 

I officially 'came out' at 16 years old in High School. I went to a Christian private school and I remember most of the other guys asked me whether I wanted to be prayed for LOL. I told them no, I knew who I was and was happy. I had a major crush on another guy in my year (2 actually). I told the first one who told me he was flattered but not interested, the second one burst into tears and told me to fuck off. I felt destined to be lonely and didn't consider myself to be very good looking. I entered into quite a big depression and ended up getting addicted to prescription painkillers- thats a whole different story. 

At the age of 18 I announced to my parents I was heading out to Oxford Street for a night out on the town. I drove in, went to a club and met someone about 10 years older than me who I immediately fell for. It turns out this guy was mega rich (I honestly didn't know that at the time) and I soon moved in with him. I stayed in a relationship with him for about 5 years and travelled the world, flew business class, got educated at college - really kind of lived the life. 

I got really hooked on drugs badly and it kind of messed me up for a while. When I broke up with the rich guy I moved back with my Mum for a couple of years and looking back on it - I was really in a dark place.

I don't know what the fuck that means since he just left me for Lisa. Now I'm really <mask> because now that I'm not pregnant, I want to be, and I want my marriage to not be over even though I hate him for what hes done to me. And why would he text me that? Is he changing his mind? I am so <mask>. I wish these past few days never happened so there would be nothing wrong still.. I know I shouldn't forgive him if he wants another chance but 10 years of marriage... We were going to be parents.. Fuck I am so <mask> and hurt I can't even think straight..

TDLR: Rick left me for Lisa. I'm not pregnant but I am having weird feelings about that. Lisa left me a letter in my mailbox and then Rick attempted to call me. He texted me something that confused me even more. Now I have no idea what is going on and I don't know what to do. Is he changing his mind?

31200,14owthg,"Moved away from my abusive household about nine months ago and my life keeps better ever since. Turns out I'm actually a capable adult and not the infantilized preschooler my parents kept treating me as! Who would've guessed? I moved out when I was 23. I would've loved to have moved out the second I turned 18, but my country's housing market is a complete fucking joke and any ""help"" you seek for affordable housing basically tries forcing you into poverty and bad decisions for the rest of your life, so I ended up saving up as much money as I could while still living there and left when I felt <mask>. 

When the day came to leave, I ended up getting caught and they all tried coercing me into staying and even forced air tags onto me so they could track me wherever I went. I basically yelled at all of them and called them out for the constant abuse and infantilization they put me through all these years, and their reactions were... well, something. My father blatantly refused to acknowledge the fact that he's an alcoholic that both physically and mentally abused all of us for little to no fucking reason on a daily basis for years on end. My mom's reaction to me calling her out for physical and emotional abuse and for constantly enabling my father was to constantly repeat over and over again how ""since it happened so long ago, it doesn't matter anymore"" and that I should just get over it already. My brother's reaction to me calling him out for treating me poorly and giving me body issues by constantly making remarks about me being overweight was to immediately gaslight me, tell me I was having ""fake memories"" and tried excusing our father's abuse of our whole family as a product of his childhood... as if that somehow makes it any better? Fuck right off. 

Unfortunately I'm still low contact with them despite wanting to be no-contact (long story short, I got caught packing up my stuff and it turned into this huge fucking ordeal to the point where my online friend turned roommate who works a job involved with law enforcement had to drive 600 miles to rescue me and lowkey intimidated my family into letting me go), but GOD I will take the mental equivalent of weekly probation calls over the shit I was dealing with before.

32433,8asv61,"He had mentioned right away he had a girlfriend and was never shy to talk about her. We became friends and I had become really infatuated with him. About a year after working together he had told me that he was quitting and moving to another city with his girlfriend who recently graduated. I was a bit devastated as I was always hoping they'd break up but another part of me was hoping that being out of proximity would let me get over him and I'd stop being sad about wanting someone unavailable. 

I became increasingly concerned that I was always thinking about him despite trying to date other people. I made a point not to entertain sexual or romantic day dreams however I found myself always wondering how he was doing, what he was up to, or curious about things like what his opinion would be on a book I recently read. Despire years going by barely in contact with him, I still felt in <mask> with him. Dating other people felt like I was just distracting myself and I hated feeling like I was treating people like substitutes. 

Fast forward to about 7 months ago, he starts talking to me pretty often over text message. He had recently moved back to our city and was attending the university I just started working at. I was curious why he was messaging me so much but still I hadn't gotten my hopes up at all considering I knew he and his girlfriend were together for the last 3 years at least so I didn't automatically suspect they had broken up just because him moving back. We began to talk late into the night most days but I had not mentioned I was single, I didn't want to be too impulsive. Of course talking all day into the night is a pretty obvious sign you are interested in someone so one night he had messaged me saying something along the lines of ""I don't know if you care or this matters to you but my girlfriend and I are currently together but in an open relationship. Maybe you aren't interested, but I thought I should disclose that"".

I felt completely <mask>. I told him that I was glad he was upfront and that he told me because I was working up to asking him to go out sometime but I was not <mask> in any kind of 3rd person being involved in this. I later asked him why they were in an open relationship to begin with and he said they were going to break up when she moved out of the state but were staying ""openly"" together until then.","['in love', 'shocked', 'interested']","['surprised', 'love', 'humiliated']",option1,1.0,,,,1.0,LLM

But then I wondered what else would be down there. What unnatural sights would greet me as the camera reached the base of the spire? What was at the bottom? Atlantis? Rapture? Mermaids?

Im not sure how long I stood there, endlessly lowering hundreds upon hundreds of feet of rope down into the murky sea. I glanced up and watched as the sun was beginning to set on the horizon, painting everything in a serene orange hue. 

And then I felt the rope go limp as if the camera had finally reached the seafloor. 

A jolt of excitement coursed through me, and I actually felt a bit <mask>. In my mind, I pictured what the camera was looking at at this very moment, and soon, I would be able to view it as well. 

I let it sit on the bottom for a couple of minutes before I began the tedious task of reeling it back up. 

Things were going well until I suddenly felt a bit of resistance while pulling. I looked down and observed a strange abundance of bubbles rising to the surface, similar to the bubbles I had seen only a couple of days prior. I thought it strange but continued as usual.

But then, to my utter shock and horror, the rope began violently tugging, the same way a fishing rod does once youve caught something big. 

I was completely <mask>, and I began panicking. I strained my arms and desperately tried to resist, but whatever force was pulling the other end of the rope was way stronger than me. 

The tugging became so violent that I had to let go of the rope out of fear of rope burn. 

I watched helplessly as more and more rope flew over the edge of the boat and disappeared into the water. Whatever it was kept dragging the camera further away from the boat.  

Soon, there wouldnt be enough rope left, and it would start tugging on the boats railing. Would it break the railing? Or maybe, as absurd as it seems, start dragging the boat under? I couldnt chance it.

She was informed that if she ran, shed be facing a lengthy prison sentence. She only had two months left in the court ordered facility. We have no idea who picked her up or where she is. We dont even know if shes currently still in the same city she was staying in. My intuition told me something was off before she ran. The day we learned that she disappeared, my family and I posted publicly trying to find her. We had no idea if she was even still alive. Fentanyl is in everything in the city shes in. She reached out to one person that night, ignored all my messages asking if she was safe, then asked me for money. I said absolutely not. She refused to tell me what was going on.

The sound is really difficult to explain, but it was an otherworldly, electronic whirling/tapping sound that I imagine was something large spinning extremely fast, eventually slowing down and coming to a stop.

Why is everyone constantly complaining about the ending? I mean, yes, it wasn't perfect, but with so many fan theories and possibilities and loose ends before Season 4 B - it's just not possible to please everybody.

Of course you can dislike with how it ended and how it all turned out a bit like 'It was all a dream'. I totally get the lost character development, the missed opportunities, the inconsistencies. I'm sure there could be some alternative endings that would have satisfied more fans.

I watched a YouTube video of the reactions of the cast on the ending of Manifest and I read some comments and they were so positive!! I feel like the negative reactions all compromise on reddit. So here I am, stating my opinion:

I liked the ending.

After finishing the last episode, I was honestly <mask> that it ended. I could have watched a lot more episodes, even seasons and I felt bad for the show, that it got canceled and everything.

I think we should appreciate this last season more. Imagine not having it, we would be stuck with the last five minutes of the third season - Grace dead, Cal old, Eden with Angelina. This would break my heart.

Just think about how hard it must have been, having to cut ideas for three seasons into one. Of course you  don't have time for every last detail (although I'm not saying that it would have been a perfect ending, if there had been the other two seasons).

I'm <mask> it ended and the ending was fine. Change my mind.


Edit: I think I understood why some people hate it and some love it. It's the expectations you have before starting the show. When you want a fascinating sci-fi series with technology and its explanations, you will be disappointed.

7420,149qf6a,"My (26F) boyfriend (27M) abruptly quit his job with no backup plan. A year ago my boyfriend moved in with me, to house that I own and am currently paying a mortgage on with the agreement that he would contribute weekly for bills and groceries. He also has an expensive car loan which is around $800 a month.
  

  
A few months ago he expressed concerns to me that his workplace was heading in a bad direction and he was unhappy with the new management they had introduced. I encouraged him to start looking for a new job while working at his current one, but also warned him that there is a recession looming, and leaving solid employment is a very risky move. He agreed with me that he would start to look for a new job, however he never did. Of course, 6 weeks later the job had become unbearable for him mentally so he handed in his resignation with no new job lined up.
  

  
We are now almost 7 weeks into him being unemployed and unable to even land an interview, the car loan has completely eaten his savings and he is no longer contributing to groceries and bills. I have had to lend him money to keep him from defaulting on his car loan, and money to pay for his pet's medical bills. I am financially struggling to lend him this money as I've been hit hard by mortgage rate rises and cost of living. I expect to have to loan him more money again soon.
  

  
I want to make clear that all other aspects of our life are great. He treats me with all the love and care in the world and is the absolute best part of my day. However the seeds of doubt have been planted in my head. I have had many weeks to think about what happened and come to the conclusion that I feel <mask> by his decision. I feel he did not take me into consideration at all, and did not think of the consequences on both of us if he was to just walk away from his job.
  

  
I am at a crossroads in my life, my options are to ride the lightning and hope he finds a job soon, but potentially have this mistrust and doubt hanging over me forever. The 2nd option is to end the relationship and move back in with my family, so I can put my house up for rent and try to rebalance my financials to weather the oncoming recession.",['hurt'],['betrayed'],option2,2.0,,,,0.0,LLM

I found that the more I did the more I wanted to do more like a ball rolling down a hill gaining momentum and I found myself wanting to see what my absolute limits were.

As far as workouts go I didnt have much of an issue making it to the gym although I did notice having slightly less energy and excitement to get a workout in.

Getting this much done was as much an exercise in not doing things as it was in doing them. I didnt turn on the TV once, I didnt sit around on social media when I should have been working, I didnt lay in bed for an hour before getting up because I simply framed it in my mind that that wasn't an option to do those things. And the craziest thing was I didnt even have desire to do those things.

During this period I couldnt have been more pleased with the productivity however it probably wasnt 100% sustainable

Mentality:

Despite some drawbacks later on I felt extremely <mask> and happy with myself day after day. I am someone who prides himself in being a hard worker and it was an amazing feeling to look back week after week and know that I couldnt have given anymore effort and was surprised in how much I could actually handle.

If youre like me and like to be identified as a hard worker I will tell you right now if youre really putting in the hours people will notice and they will comment much quicker than you think. Within 3 weeks of consistent work I received almost daily comments from employees about how many hours ive been putting in or being crazy for how late I was there the night before. I sat on the sofa one day after work and my brother said to someone this is the longest youll ever see him sitting down

I am a calm person by default but during this marathon I was even more calm, had lower stress and had zero anxious moments, most likely due to a combination of being exhausted and not having any time to sit and worry about anything. It actually increased my confidence.

8839,c6ueh4,"Two years ago, I posted in this group confessing some dark thoughts about where I was mentally and how I felt <mask>. Today, Ive officially let go of everything that was holding me down. My brother came up for a visit about a year ago or so, and having not seen me in quite a while I think it hit him pretty hard how rough I was taking life. 

He gave me the kick up the arse I needed and got me started on a Keto diet which I slid into very easily and didnt find it hard to adapt. 
He constantly checked up on me, gave me life advice and girl advice and made me feel like I was saveable. 

Current day:
Ive lost close to 30kg, (66lb)
Quit my awful job, started a new one and was offered an apprenticeship 6 months ago, 
Made a friends group who take me out drinking and we have fun all the time
I moved out of my parents home incredibly impulsive and it was the best decision I made, it led to so many new opportunities with people and stuff to do. 
And most importantly, Ive met a girl who I absolutely adore. And she seems to really enjoy my company also. 

This post isnt meant to be a brag or me gloating so please dont take it that way. 
2 years ago, on the drive to my shitty job, I used to pick out trees that I was going to drive my car into as fast as I could (everyday). I was taking days off of work every week just so I could sleep, I had a codeine addiction and would cry nearly every night as I would lay there and stare at the ceiling, too miserable to live, but too scared to kill myself. 

I understand not everyone has an amazing brother to help them make the start and get the ball rolling. But once he did, the rest was all me. The motivation and energy came from within myself. 
I didnt know it was in there and I have never felt this way in my life. 

So perhaps try and see this post as a small kick in the gooch that you needed today. There is a place in this world for everyone you just have to push afew obstacles out of the way to find the perfect fit.

After the events of the post, I sent my boyfriend an email (after we spoke on the phone and I voiced all my concerns), essentially saying that I loved him but we had different needs. He wrote me a long email back, which was very surprising to me since he doesn't like to show emotion in any way. He said he feels as if he's become a shell of a person and that he would really like to work on things. I agreed to try, vowing to myself that something major had to change.

During all this, I bought 'Attached' by Amir Levine (after a few commenters suggested it). It completely changed my outlook. I identified so strongly with the anxious attachment style and I really felt my boyfriend was avoidant. A lot of our problems made sense. I started to work on sorting through those issues individually in therapy. I tried to put a stop to my protest behaviours completely (threatening to leave during fights, ignoring messages in hopes that he'll 'miss me', asking for reassurance often). I even recommended that he read the book. He read the first chapter and immediately agreed that we were anxious/avoidant.

Over a month later, I've felt a growing distance. The future is looming and decisions need to be made. I started doing more without him. Looking at flats alone for once. Yesterday, after weeks of not discussing 'the relationship', I asked him if he felt a disconnect too and he said he did and was glad I said it. We then agreed that it wasn't working and likely never would due to our differences. 

I'm pretty devastated. We ended on incredibly good terms and I still think the world of him. It's hard for me to know if I'm doing the right thing or if I expect too much. He's such a stable, solid, kind presence in my life and I feel thoroughly <mask>. I do realise that I went through this for a reason, it's just hard to remember that right now.

Forward to back to the side of the bag is ok, but the O rings should be stable so the handles cannot shift side in an upright position. After properly understanding such a simple concept I felt much more <mask> that I have yet to receive a dude (woohoo! But in due time Im sure). However, I do think the shape of the handles is just a touch off but again I cant explain exactly why, but if anyone here can enlighten me Id love to learn (-0.5)

- stitching: to mee the stitching looks pretty good. It is the same color as the bag, decently uniform, the shapes seem clean and uniform in size as well. There are no visible loose stitches, the seams are clean and the pattern looks accurate. The one area is the inside handles where it looks like the leather is tearing just a bit (-0.5)

-One other thing that looks a bit off to me is the hole where the needle goes in (I completely forget what its called) looks big. I would never notice this in a million years but it is technically there and I promised to do my best with the research so therefore it must be mentioned (-0.5)

You *really* shouldnt make such jokes, Amilita said, expression finally souring.

Sorry, my face fell a little. Id given in too much to temptation. I really shouldnt. Um

I felt a bit bad about my attempt at humor. Amilita hadnt been *perfectly* honest with me, but shed been good. Respectable, honorable. Shed thrown away the career of a soldier under her over doing the wrong thing to a human- admittedly, with a bit of family pressure from the Raktens, but it seemed to be one of those people who everyone respected. She was competent, and, most of all, willing to listen. That put her head-and-shoulders above most adults Id talked to- human or alien.

Let me make it up to you with an insight, then? I think the people you are meeting with are more obsessed with how they look in your eyes. Theyre only talking to you because they think it will get them ahead in life. Im <mask> theyll start doing so with me, too, and I was actually going to ask for help with how to deflect that effectively.

It *does* help to have a separate power structure, she muttered. But that doesnt really explain *why* theyre so boring, when human culture is so *interesting*. Here I am making first contact with a planet full of men, and I can barely keep myself from yawning in front of them, or let them finish their sentences before interrupting, because I get so impatient when its the exact same as the last time, and the time before.

Simple enough. They all want the same thing. They arent there to educate you on something interesting, nor to ask questions to learn, or get to the bottom of what happened when you show up after somethings gone wrong. They arent trying to really *truly* interact with you- just to get something from you, every time, even if its just to get you to go away or let them survive in their job post after something went wrong. Thats why theyre so boring. The conversations and words are pleasant but bland, forgettable, and Im guessing they frequently turn matters to business and negotiation after only a few sentences?",['worried'],['afraid'],Both,12.0,,Terms have similar meanings,,1.0,both

Things started to go down hill pretty quick. Out of nowhere my boyfriend started to being jealous about this shit. I didn't know why he didn't care at all at first. I was very <mask> but me and Tom decided to stop any romantic and sexual relation from then on. Tho it was only via internet and just pleasuring ourself together by voice. That's when my boyfriend told me to get rid of Tom.. and I couldn't. I was not able to choose between my boyfriend, a guy who I only knew via internet. My boyfriend was never good at bed stuff.. He asked me few times ""where's your hole"" during our romantic times. He always looked at me with that disgusting face while trying to pleasure me. Tom always described what he is going to do with me, how he is going to do it. That was turning me on more than sex with my boyfriend only when he wanted and how he wanted. I felt like a toy for him.  
I went through another hell trying to explain to my boyfriend that I want to try polyamorous relationship, because I loved Tom so much, and I didn't want to lose my boyfriend. After long hours of talking we finally came to agreement. That we are going to try this, and if anything will go right we will proceed. I was so fucking <mask>. So happy to have Tom with his affection and my boyfriend.. But at the same time I felt infinite <mask> for having them both. Tom was trying his best to make sure that me and my boyfriend are going to stay together. He was ready to leave me if things wend downhill again, but he loved me so much. Every day saying how much he does, and how much he would love to just give me the affection I was lacking. My boyfriend on the other hand, despite the fact that he said, he is going to change.. He didn't do anything. Things still were rough. He was hurting me a lot by his action, and I was feeling more down and down. I started therapy being pretty sure that all of this is my fault.

I did as I was instructed, but rather than finally finding relief, my mental and physical health took a nose dive over the next six months. I ended up being put on several different medications I had never tried before, but each one failed to produce a positive result. My anxiety and depression continued to get worse and worse.

I was becoming so weak I could barely make it through a work day. People were noticing how much weight I was losing and they started congratulating me for getting healthier. During my breaks at work I would go upstairs to an unoccupied office in a state of extreme anxiety, I would lay on the floor in the dark and cry intensely while praying to God, asking him what was happening to me and begging him to help me.

On the ride home, my wife was driving and I was sitting in the passenger seat and I began to experience an intense agitation in my body. I was burning up and I felt like I had a serious flu. The agitation in my body felt like there was nervous energy coursing through my veins making me want to twitch and move. It was extremely unpleasant and made it impossible for me to even just sit there and relax. Breathing exercises did nothing. Meditation did nothing. Xanax did nothing. I later found out that what I was experiencing was most likely symptoms of akathisia.

22044,idd62u,"My self-sabotage has never been so bad. Im finally feeling how I am hurting my loved ones. I feel like since I started college I have been falling. I was always a good student throughout high school, if a little forgetful, and I made it work. But since starting college I have just let my forgetfulness and deliberate procrastination wreck it all.

I dont know if it started when I was raped my first semester, or if I was always going to go down this path, but I flunked out of my dream school after two years of putting things off, seeing deadlines approach with increasing anxiety and simply doing nothing until they had just about passed me by. 

I dont know why I do this. I got into a different school and completed the pre-requisites for a program that I really wanted, all this time just barely managing to work with the anxiety I felt about even looking at my email or course website. This summer I was accepted into my program and had to complete a background check to start classes, but then I did it again. Every day I told myself I would feel less <mask> about it tomorrow. And now it is too late.

I dont know how I let myself do this AGAIN. This is the one time I had something easy to do and I couldnt do it. I feel the worst about my parents. They put so much work and money in to my education and I let them down time and again. I feel like nothing matters and everything matters from hour to hour. When I do group work I can kick these self-sabotaging behaviors for long enough to make sure the group is thrilled with my work but when I have to perform individually I find it so hard to bring myself to do anything that will help me. Now that I have dragged this shit on I am starting to feel like in the group project of getting a fucking degree and getting out of college I didnt realize that I was letting my parents down when I was making all those shitty decisions about putting stuff off. I would see it when I looked back at the end of each semester but when I was in it I dont know what came over me.

The shield just looked like a slab of brown bark that had been ripped off some tree, but I knew firsthand that thing could be dangerous.

His pink eyes peaked out from underneath his long black hair, and I could see him flashing a wide grin as he twirled his spear around. Im not mistaken Varnir was around the eighth or ninth place in the class, so he was far from being some hack.

gosh! I don't even know where to start. Maybe thank you for supporting me on my last post (beside the few worthless ""why don't you just leave"" comments), I just wanted to vent and share my story but many of you have requested an update after I have moved.

I got the keys to my little apartment 2 weeks ago because the previous tenant move out earlier. I was <mask> because I wanted to paint the room and do some makeover. I talked to the landlady and ended up telling her my whole story. lol. She promised me he next two bedroom that becames available. When I got the keys I felt that I could finally breathe. I'm not on good terms with my family but I ended up telling them what's been going on in my life this past year and my friends too. I don't know why I kept this a secret for so long. Maybe because I was too <mask> or embarrassed, or maybe because I had a definite plan and I didn't want outside influence or distraction. I didn't want my best friend to feel obligated to host me. I didn't want my sister to ask if *""I could forgive him""*, or my in-laws to try and *""change his mind""*. So the best thing I knew was to keep quiet and act like everything was normal.

I moved last Friday. I had packed all my kitchen gear and my sons and my clothes, toys etc while my husband was at work. My best friend and her husband helped me. I didn't take any of the furniture because I thought it could wait until we divorced and I requested division of property. I have no room for anything in my little apartment anyway. When my husband came home I told him that I was leaving. He was confused at first but I told him about my new apartment so he asked me how I was going to afford it.","['grateful', 'ashamed']","['excited', 'ashamed']",option2,2.0,,,,0.0,LLM
